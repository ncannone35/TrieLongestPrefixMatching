In this lab, we experimented with prefix tries.  We wrote the Trie class which implemented methods that inserted strings into the trie, searched the trie for the closest prefix to a specific string, found the height and size of tries, and printed the trie.
To run the program, one must fulfill the specific requirements of the command line prompt.  The Lab5.java file contains the main method and the Trie.java file contains the Trie class and Node Class.
